# Create a Pull Request

## Workflow

1. **Commit** any uncommitted changes with a clear commit message.
2. **Push** the branch with the worker push helper:
   `BRANCH="$(git branch --show-current)"; "${AGENT_TEAM_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.agent_team}/agents/worker/scripts/git-push-verify.sh" "$BRANCH"`.
3. **Create the PR** with the pinned GitHub wrapper:
   `GH_AUTH="${AGENT_TEAM_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.agent_team}/skills/github/scripts/github-auth.sh"; "$GH_AUTH" gh pr create ...`.

## PR format

- Title under 70 characters. Keep details in the body.
- Pass the body via HEREDOC with this structure:

```
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points>

## Test plan
<Bulleted checklist of verification steps>

## Linking a PM-tool ticket

If a ticket was mentioned or worked on earlier in this conversation, include a reference in the PR body so the PM tool can auto-close or track the ticket on merge:

- `Closes <ticket URL>` — this PR fully resolves the ticket.
- `Contributes to <ticket URL>` — this PR is partial progress.

Look for ticket references already in the conversation: Linear URLs (e.g. `https://linear.app/<org>/issue/<PREFIX>-<n>/...`), GitHub issue URLs (e.g. `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>`), owner/repo#number references, or ticket codes matching the consumer's `linear.ticket_prefix` from `.agent_team/config.toml` if that file exists. Don't fabricate ticket references — if no ticket was discussed, skip the link and open the PR without one.

## Notes

- PM-tool URL resolution is handled by the calling agent and the configured provider context; this skill only formats the PR body and invokes `gh`.
- The `Co-Authored-By` trailer in commits is handled by the calling agent's commit workflow, not this skill.
- Do not run raw `gh` from a worker. Use `github-auth.sh gh ...` so PR creation uses the configured GitHub actor rather than the ambient active account.
