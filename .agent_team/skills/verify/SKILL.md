# Deterministic verification

Use this skill from the `verifier` agent. It checks out the worker commit in a temporary detached worktree, runs declared gates with streamed progress, records job gate results, and writes evidence under `target/agent-evidence/`.

## Command

```sh
"$AGENT_TEAM_ROOT"/skills/verify/scripts/verify.sh --complete-step
```

Useful flags:

```sh
verify.sh [--job JOB_ID] [--repo REPO_ROOT] [--branch REF] [--commit SHA]
          [--gates-file PATH] [--evidence-dir PATH]
          [--no-record-gates] [--complete-step] [--keep-worktree]
```

## Declaring Gates

Prefer declaring gate commands in the verifier pipeline step instructions with a fenced block:

````toml
instructions = """
Run the verify skill.

```agent-team-verify-gates
gofmt-check :: test -z "$(gofmt -l .)"
go-vet :: go vet ./...
go-test :: go test ./...
```
"""
````

Each non-empty line is either `name :: command` or a bare command. Bare commands get generated names. Commands run from the temporary checkout root with Bash.

If no gate block is found and the source repo contains `go.mod`, the runner falls back to `gofmt-check`, `go-vet`, and `go-test`.

Gate commands receive:

- `AGENT_TEAM_EVIDENCE_DIR`: the run's evidence directory.
- `AGENT_TEAM_GATE_EVIDENCE_DIR`: a per-gate directory for files that should be attached as evidence.
- `AGENT_TEAM_GATE_NAME`: the current gate name.
- `AGENT_TEAM_GATE_LOG`: the gate log path.

Files written under `AGENT_TEAM_GATE_EVIDENCE_DIR` are included as
`evidence_refs` in the verifier JSON and summary. GUI slices can opt into the
bundled visual-QA gate:

```agent-team-verify-gates
visual-qa :: "$AGENT_TEAM_ROOT/skills/visual-qa/scripts/visual_qa.sh" --app-command "npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173" --url "http://127.0.0.1:4173"
```

The visual-QA helper captures screenshots only. A vision-capable reviewer must
judge the screenshots before approval.

These default verifier gates are the **smoke** tier declared in
`.agent_team/gates.toml`. Passing them means local smoke passed; it does not
prove acceptance or release readiness. Acceptance and release claims must be
checked against the tier config with explicit evidence, for example:

```sh
python3 "${AGENT_TEAM_ROOT:-.agent_team}/skills/verify/scripts/validate_gate_tiers.py" --claim release \
  --evidence target/agent-evidence/<job>.release.json
```

A release claim with only smoke evidence must fail.

## Evidence

The runner writes:

- `target/agent-evidence/<job>.json` - schema version, source commit, gate statuses, timings, log refs, and summary.
- `target/agent-evidence/<job>.exact-head.json` - for PR-backed green candidates, the authenticated GitHub query provenance, checkout/evidence/head decision, and SHA-256 digest of the canonical verifier JSON.
- `target/agent-evidence/<job>.summary.md` - short human summary.
- `target/agent-evidence/logs/<job>/<gate>.log` - full combined stdout/stderr for each gate.

The verifier does not edit product files. It writes evidence artifacts and temporary checkout state only.

## PR-backed exact-head gate

When durable job data contains a canonical GitHub PR URL, the verifier queries
the PR head through the configured authenticated GitHub helper before it
consults any explicit commit, local branch, remote-tracking ref, worker
worktree, or repository `HEAD`. It then fetches `refs/pull/<number>/head` from a
matching `origin` and requires the fetched full SHA to equal the authenticated
query.

After deterministic gates pass, the verifier queries the authenticated PR head
again immediately before publishing green evidence. Checkout commit, canonical
evidence commit, and the fresh GitHub head must be identical full SHAs. Missing,
malformed, unavailable, or unequal identity produces an `exact-head` gate with
`class: infra`, a stable closed reason, a failure attestation, and no successful
step advance. Non-PR-backed verification keeps the existing local resolution
path.

## Base-broken discriminator

After a gate fails, the runner discovers the remote default branch directly
from `origin`, fetches that branch without trusting local remote-tracking refs,
pins the fetched commit SHA in evidence, computes its merge-base with the worker
commit, and reruns only that failed gate in a detached checkout. For a
single, plain `go test <packages>` gate, the rerun is narrowed to the failed packages
and anchored top-level test names parsed from the head log. Go failures carry
package/test identities, including complete subtest paths, and a non-zero base
run counts as reproduction only when every head identity appears at the
merge-base. Only the scoped rerun's `-run` expression is anchored at top-level
parent tests. A Go compile or build failure with no test identities instead
requires the same exit code and a non-empty SHA-256 fingerprint of the entire
ANSI-stripped output. Partially identified Go failures remain ambiguous and do
not use the fingerprint fallback. This prevents an old failing test or subtest
from hiding a new head-only regression while still recognizing an identical
pre-existing compile failure.

Structured identity matching is enabled only when the entire gate parses as one
recognized `go test`, `unittest`, or `pytest` invocation. Compound commands,
redirected commands, command substitutions, and otherwise ambiguous shell
shapes cannot use an identity subset to claim that the whole gate reproduced;
they require the same exit code and a non-empty SHA-256 fingerprint of the
entire ANSI-stripped output. Other runners and recognized test invocations with
no complete structured identities use that same conservative fingerprint
comparison. The runner never compares only the final output line, so distinct
failures with the same generic footer do not become `base-broken`.
Pytest completeness accounts for both `FAILED` and `ERROR` identities and
requires each footer count to match; an unrepresented setup, teardown, or
collection error keeps the worker failure classified as content.
Missing or empty output, a missing command or file at the base, and any other
ambiguous comparison preserve the head classification.

- If the scoped gate also fails at the merge-base, the result records
  `class: infra` and `signature: base-broken`. The pipeline's semantic
  `base_broken` infra signature makes the durable job gate classification agree.
- If the scoped gate passes at the merge-base, the original failure signature
  is preserved, so existing signature-based classification is unchanged.
- If remote-default discovery or fetch, the merge-base, or the base checkout is
  unavailable,
  the original failure signature is preserved and the evidence contains both
  an `unavailable` comparison result and a warning.

Every failed gate receives a `base_comparison` object in the JSON evidence. A
completed comparison includes the default-branch ref and pinned fetched SHA,
merge-base commit, scoped command, reproduction basis, head/base exit statuses,
structured failure identities or full-output fingerprints, duration, and base
log path.
Passing gate records are unchanged and do not trigger a base checkout.
